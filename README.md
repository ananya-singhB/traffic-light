# traffic-light

This small React traffic light application simulates a traffic light system that automatically cycles through red, yellow, and green signals while allowing users to manually change the signal using a dropdown menu. It utilizes the useState hook to manage the current signal and the useEffect hook to update the signal at specified intervals (5 seconds for red and green, 2 seconds for yellow). The UI visually represents the active light and includes a selector for user input, making it an interactive demonstration of state management and effects in React.
